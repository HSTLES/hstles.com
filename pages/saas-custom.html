        <h2>The HSTLES Engagement Model</h2>
        <p>A structured process that gets you from legacy to modern without the traditional development pain</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Step 1 -->
    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">
            <header>
                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-comments"></span> 1. Free Initial Consultation</h3>
            </header>
            <p>We start with a no-cost, no-obligation session where we:
                <br>• Walk through your existing application and workflows
                <br>• Understand the data you handle and outcomes you need
                <br>• Identify quick wins and risks
                <br><br>If we both agree there's a good fit, we move forward with a structured engagement.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 2 -->
    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">
            <header>
                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-file-alt"></span> 2. Scope Pack - Clarity Before Code</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Before anyone spends real money, we produce a concise <strong>Scope Pack</strong> that includes:
                <br>• Problem and outcomes (what we're solving, how success is measured)
                <br>• In scope (core workflows, user types, integrations)
                <br>• Out of scope (future features not part of this phase)
                <br>• Assumptions (data formats, access requirements, dependencies)
                <br><br>This becomes the single source of truth for what we're actually building.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 3 -->
    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">
            <header>
                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-hand-holding-usd"></span> 3. Low Initial Engagement Fee</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Instead of a large traditional development quote, we charge a <strong>one-time low engagement fee</strong> that:
                <br>• Is intentionally far less than a standard full custom build
                <br>• Secures the engagement and commitment from both sides
                <br>• Unlocks the full storyboard, design, and build process
                <br><br>When your solution goes live, this fee is converted into <strong>credit for your first months of platform access</strong> - so you're not paying twice.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 4 -->
    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">
            <header>
                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-pencil-ruler"></span> 4. Co-Design and Build</h3>
            </header>
            <p>We don't just take a brief and disappear. We work alongside your team to:
                <br>• Storyboard and map key workflows
                <br>• Design screens and interactions
                <br>• Implement your application inside the HSTLES platform
                <br><br>You see progress, give feedback, and help shape the end product.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 5 -->

        <div class="content">

                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-check-circle"></span> 5. Clear Completion and Warranty</h3>
            </header>
            <p>We break delivery into three stages:
                <br><strong>1. Storyboard sign-off</strong> - You confirm the proposed flows and screen layouts
                <br><strong>2. UAT (User Acceptance Testing)</strong> - We deploy to test environment, you run scenarios, we fix defects
                <br><strong>3. Production go-live and completion</strong> - Once agreed scenarios pass, the project is complete
                <br><br>A <strong>warranty period</strong> begins where we fix scope-related defects at no extra cost.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 6 -->
    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">

                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-server"></span> 6. Fixed-Term Lease with SLAs</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Your custom application runs on our infrastructure as a <strong>leased service</strong>:
                <br>• Fixed-term, predictable pricing
                <br>• Hosting, maintenance, and monitoring included
                <br>• <strong>SLAs</strong> for uptime, response times, and support
                <br>• Regular backups and operational care as part of the service
                <br><br>You get the benefits of a bespoke application without owning and operating the underlying platform.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 7 -->
    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">

                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-plus-circle"></span> 7. Simple Path for Changes and New Features</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Businesses change. So we make enhancements easy:
                <br>• You raise a feature request or change
                <br>• We review and confirm if it's a <strong>defect</strong> (in scope) or <strong>enhancement</strong> (new work)
                <br>• Enhancements are priced with <strong>bespoke mini quotes</strong> and scheduled as small follow-on work
                <br><br>This keeps your application evolving without restarting from zero every time.</p>

                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-dollar-sign"></span> Pricing & Billing</h3>
            </header>
            
            <h4>Why do I pay a monthly lease instead of just buying the software?</h4>
            <p>Traditional software "ownership" is a myth. If you buy code, you inherit the cost of hosting, securing, fixing, and updating it forever. Our lease model bundles all those headaches into one predictable fee. You're paying for a <em>working service</em>, not just a static pile of code.</p>
            
            <h4>What happens to my Engagement Fee?</h4>
            <p>It's not a sunk cost! Once your system goes live, your Engagement Fee is applied as a credit to your monthly lease. Essentially, your first few months of the platform are free.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I cancel the lease?</h4>
            <p>Yes. After your initial fixed term (usually 12 or 24 months), you can switch to a month-to-month arrangement or renew for a discount. If you leave, you can take your data with you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Ownership & Data -->

                <h3><span class="icon solid fa-database"></span> Ownership & Data</h3>
            </header>
            
            <h4>Who owns the data?</h4>
            <p>You do. 100%. We are just the custodians. You can export your data at any time.</p>
            
            <h4>Who owns the code?</h4>
            <p>HSTLES owns the underlying platform and the specific configuration of your solution. This allows us to maintain it efficiently. If we were to cease operations, our "Escrow" clause ensures you get access to everything needed to run your app independently.</p>
            
            <h4>Where is my data stored?</h4>
            <p>For Australian clients, all data is stored in Sydney-based data centres to comply with data sovereignty requirements.</p>

            <h4>What if something breaks?</h4>
            <p>That's on us. Our SLA (Service Level Agreement) guarantees response times. If it's a defect in the system we built, we fix it for free.</p>
            
            <h4>What if I want to add a new feature later?</h4>
            <p>We love that! Just submit a Change Request. We'll give you a fixed price or estimate for the new work. It's much cheaper and faster than starting a new project because the foundation is already there.</p>
            
            <h4>Do you provide training?</h4>
            <p>Yes. We provide user guides and a "train the trainer" session as part of the handover.</p>

            <p>Usually, yes. If the system has a modern API, we can connect to it. We'll assess this during the Scope Pack phase.</p>
            
            <h4>Is it secure?</h4>
            <p>Yes. We use enterprise-grade encryption, secure authentication, and isolated infrastructure. We treat your data with the same care as a bank would. <a href="security.html">Learn more about our security practices</a>.</p>
