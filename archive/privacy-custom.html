                    <h3>Data Ownership & Isolation</h3>
                    <p><strong>You own your data.</strong> When we build a custom solution for you, your business data belongs to you, not HSTLES. We act as a data processor on your behalf, not a controller. You control who accesses your data and can export or migrate at any time.
                    <br><br><strong>Isolated environments:</strong> Each solution runs in its own secure environment with dedicated databases, isolated authentication, and no data sharing between clients. S1/S2 tiers use logical separation; S3 Premium offers dedicated compute and optional private networking.
                    <br><br><strong>Minimal HSTLES access:</strong> We access your data only during development (with your test data), for support (with permission), platform maintenance, and security updates. All access is logged and auditable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Transport:</strong> TLS 1.3 for client communications, mTLS for internal services, VL1 mesh networking with Noise Protocol encryption for platform traffic - aligned with ACSC Essential Eight security controls.
                    <br><br><strong>Application:</strong> Role-based access control tailored to your solution, JWT authentication with scope permissions, API rate limiting, DDoS protection, input validation and injection prevention per Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) guidelines.
                    <br><br><strong>Data:</strong> AES-256 database encryption at rest, encrypted backups in Australian regions (Sydney available), key rotation and management, optional client-managed keys (S3 tier). Staff access requires support ticket approval, MFA, and all access is time-limited and logged per Privacy Act requirements.</p>

            <h2>Custom SaaS Privacy Commitment</h2>
            <p>When we modernize your application onto the HSTLES platform, your data remains yours.<br>
                This policy explains how we handle data during and after custom solution development.</p>

        <header class="major">
            <h2>Core Privacy Principles</h2>
        </header>
        
        <h3>1. Your Data Ownership</h3>
        <p><strong>You own your data.</strong> When we build a custom solution for your organization:
            <br>• Your business data belongs to you, not to HSTLES
            <br>• You control who has access to your data
            <br>• We act as a data processor on your behalf, not a data controller
            <br>• You can export or migrate your data at any time</p>

        <h3>2. Data Isolation</h3>
        <p><strong>Your solution is isolated.</strong> Each custom solution runs in its own secure environment:
            <br>• Dedicated database instances with encryption at rest
            <br>• Isolated authentication and identity management
            <br>• No data sharing between clients unless explicitly configured
            <br>• Logical and/or physical separation based on your SLA tier</p>

        <h3>3. Minimal HSTLES Access</h3>
        <p><strong>We access your data only when necessary:</strong>
            <br>• During initial development and testing (with your test data)
            <br>• For technical support when you grant permission
            <br>• For platform maintenance and security updates
            <br>• To investigate reported issues or performance problems
            <br><br>All access is logged, auditable, and bound by strict confidentiality obligations.</p>

        <h3>4. No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
        <p><strong>We never sell or share your data.</strong>
            <br>• Your business data is not used for HSTLES marketing or product development
            <br>• We don't share data with third parties except as required by law or with your explicit consent
            <br>• Subprocessors (hosting, infrastructure) are carefully vetted and bound by confidentiality agreements</p>

            <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        </header>

        <h3>During Active Service</h3>
        <p>• Your application data is retained as long as your service agreement is active
            <br>• You control data retention policies within your solution (e.g., archiving old records)
            <br>• Backups are retained per your SLA (typically 30-90 days rolling)
            <br>• Audit logs are retained per your compliance requirements (often 7 years for regulated industries)</p>

        <h3>End of Service</h3>
        <p>When your service agreement ends:</p>
        <p><strong>Option 1: Data Export & Deletion (Standard)</strong>
            <br>• You receive a full data export in agreed formats (SQL, JSON, CSV, etc.)
            <br>• After confirmation of successful export, all production data is deleted within 30 days
            <br>• Backups are permanently deleted within 90 days
            <br><br><strong>Option 2: Extended Retention (By Agreement)</strong>
            <br>• Data can be retained in read-only mode for an agreed period (e.g., 6-12 months)
            <br>• Useful for transition periods or regulatory hold requirements
            <br>• Incurs reduced monthly fees for storage and access

            <br><strong>2. Notification</strong> - Inform you within 24-48 hours (faster for P1 Critical)
            <br><strong>3. Investigation</strong> - Determine root cause and impact scope
            <br><strong>4. Remediation</strong> - Fix vulnerabilities and restore service
            <br><strong>5. Post-incident report</strong> - Detailed timeline and corrective actions</p>

        <h3>Data Breach Notification</h3>
        <p>For breaches involving personal data:
            <br>• GDPR requires notification within 72 hours - we notify you immediately so you can meet this deadline
            <br>• Privacy Act 1988 requires notification per Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme - we notify within 24 hours
            <br>• We provide details needed for your breach notifications to regulators and affected individuals
            <br>• We assist with breach investigation and remediation</p>
